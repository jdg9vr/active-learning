### Report and Tutorial

Use [this link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jdg9vr/active-learning/blob/main/ActiveLearningTutorial.html) to access the tutorial. Unfortunately, the html file is too big to view on github by clicking the html but that link provides a workaround. The pdf is visible, but the html is in a preferred format for digital viewing
